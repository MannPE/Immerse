# Immerse!

Immerse is a google chrome extension that replaces pieces of text on any web-page and adds a tooltip so you can see additional info if you need it.  .  While this extension can be used for many things, the UI focuses on utilizing it for **language learning**.


## Features
- Word replacement in static webpages.
- Tooltip with the original word that was replaced.
- Add, edit, delete functionalities for your current word list.
- CSV export and import for people that use multiple computers.
- Case-sensitive modifier when replacing words.
- Domain black-list for sites where you need accurate info.

### WIP
- Word replacement in SPA or pages with continous loading.
> Missing some resource optimization and how to handle user inputs.
- Setting sync between computers.
- Custom tooltip information instead of default word.
